-- | An efficient implementation of the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm.
-- See http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs166/cs166.1166/lectures/02/Small02.pdf
-- for a good explanation of the algorithm.
--
-- The memory layout of the automaton, and the function that steps it, were
-- optimized to the point where string matching compiles roughly to a loop over
-- the code units in the input text, that keeps track of the current state.
-- Lookup of the next state is either just an array index (for the root state),
-- or a linear scan through a small array (for non-root states). The pointer
-- chases that are common for traversing Haskell data structures have been
-- eliminated.
--
-- The construction of the automaton has not been optimized that much, because
-- construction time is usually negligible in comparison to matching time.
-- Therefore construction is a two-step process, where first we build the
-- automaton as int maps, which are convenient for incremental construction.
-- Afterwards we pack the automaton into unboxed vectors.
